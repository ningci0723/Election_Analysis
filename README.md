# Election Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit

The purpose of this project is to help with an election audit for Colorado Board of Elections to conduct some analysis to figure out the largest county turnout and winner's information. In order to finish it, we need to calculate the total number of votes casted, list all the counties, calculate the total voter in each county and find out which county has the largest voter turnout. In addition, we need to calculate the total number and the percentage of votes each candidate received to find out the winner.
